<h2>Course Contract</h2>

<p>
    I, <a href="?p=introduction">Benjamin E Ferrell</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2024 WEB250 Database Driven Websites Course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
</p>

<p>
    I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world.
    I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
</p>

<p>
    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
    As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
</p>

<p>
    I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates' code directly.
    I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
</p>
