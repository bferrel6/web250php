    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
        Throughout history, dry land was humanity's domain. Over the centuries we developed increasingly sophisticated techniques
        to build structures to protect our families, our posessions, and our kingdoms, stone by stone. Until the waters came.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our collective knowledge of architecture was wiped out overnight, but our best and brightest wasted no time kicking off
        the rebuilding effort. Shipbuilders and marine biologists joined forces to reclaim the oceans for mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will never forget those who were lost in the floods and the century of marine wars that followed.
        The children of today deserve a brighter future, a safe home beneath the waves. We hold the key to that future.
